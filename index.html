                    Hi, my name is Ken Masumoto, and I'm a first-year graduate student at the University of Washington studying
                    Information Management. Information Management is the study of finding the best ways to get the correct
                    information to the correct people within companies. I'm specializing in Data Science and Information Architecture.
                    Data Science uses programming and algorithms to find things out about large sets of data. Information Architecture
                    has to do with the way things on structures on things like websites to create as little confusion as possible.

                    For hobbies, I like to run and play chess online. I ran on my high school Cross Country and Track teams, and after
                    a short hiatus through undergrad, I decided to take it up again in the summer of 2020. I've sinced joined the Husky
                    Running Club, an RSO (Registered Student Organization), and run anywhere from 40-60 miles a week. I ran the Seattle
                    Half-Marathon in November of 2021, and I finished in 1:28:15 (6:44/mile pace). In the coming year, I hope to race 
                    some 5k's, 10k's a marathon, and another half-marathon. My chess story is somewhat similar. I learned how to play
                    in elementary school and picked it back up in 2020 after a (much longer) hiatus. My online rating bounces anywhere
                    from 1300-1500.
